A port (in progress) of my [Around the US](https://github.com/kvnloughead/web_project_4) picture album project from vanilla JS to React.   The original is deployed [here](https://kvnloughead.github.io/web_project_4/dist/).

Thus far, all page components including modals have been ported as functional React components.   The modals and the image popup opens and closes, and API calls are made to the server to fetch user info and cards from the database.  

Newly (re)implemented features include:

1. adding of new cards
2. liking/unliking cards
3. deleted cards that you own
4. updating current user info and avatar

### TODO 

1. delete confirmation popup
2. form validation
3. like counter
4. smaller hand cursor

Deployed [here](http://kvnloughead.github.io/around-react).
